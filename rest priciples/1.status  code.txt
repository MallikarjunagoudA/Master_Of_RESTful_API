Here you will find one of the basic principles of the restful api

1xx	informational
2xx	successful
3xx	redirection
4xx	client-side
5xx	server-side



important status codes:

200	ok
201	content created

301	redirect permanently
302	redirect temporarily

400	bad request
401	unauthorized
404	Not found
405	method not allowed

500	internal server error
503	service unavailable

The status code is very much important when we are deal with the Http request. based on the request we will get the status code.

Thank will meet in the next principles.
